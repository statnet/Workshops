##The `statnet` Project
  
All `statnet` packages are open-source, written for the **R** computing
environment, and published on CRAN.  The source repositories are hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/statnet).   

* Need help?  For general questions and comments, please email the statnet users group 
[mailing list](https://statnet.org/trac/wiki/FrequentlyAskedQuestions#statnetusersgroup).  (Note you'll need to join first)

* Found a bug in our software? Please let us know by filing an issue in the appropriate [GitHub repository](https://github.com/statnet), with a reproducible example.

* Want to request some new functionality?  We welcome suggestions -- you can make a request by filing an issue on the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/statnet) for the specific package.  The chances that this functionality will be developed are substantially improved if the requests are accompanied by some proposed code (we are happy to review pull requests).
